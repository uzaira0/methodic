# Changelog

Release headings use the bundle version: `YYYY.M.D` with no leading zeros (`2026.9.14`),
matching the `chronicle-selfhost-<version>` bundle, its image tags, and `./chronicle update`.
One bundle per calendar day: a same-day suffix such as `-2` is a semver prerelease and
would sort below the day's release, so `./chronicle update` would refuse it.

## [Unreleased]

## [2026.9.14]

### Self-host
- `./chronicle update [--check]`: fetch latest release, verify sha256, extract beside current bundle, hand off to guarded upgrade.
- `./chronicle adopt --from <source selfhost>`: one-time cut-over from a source checkout to release bundles (pre-adopt dump, state copied, same Compose project so database volumes are reused).
- `/privacy` and `/withdrawal` redirects removed; store listings use the institutional privacy URL.
- Release bundles built by `scripts/publish-images.sh` (GHCR digest-pinned images + GitHub release). Versions `YYYY.M.D`, one bundle per day.

### Server
- Study settings revision: `ETag` on settings reads and writes, optional `If-Match` precondition, 412 with current state on conflict (V103). Per-type PATCH merges into row-locked map.
- Device uploads run atomically with the collection-halt predicate; a consent decline landing mid-upload now rejects the batch.
- Organization membership self-grant closed (V102 split RLS policies; organization aspect registered).
- Refresh-token rotation claims the row atomically; blocklist rejects tokens minted in the revocation second; nonce TTL must cover request age plus clock skew.
- Audit entries never dropped on flush retries; export create/download audited.
- Authenticated device writes require study write access.
- Exports: header kept on zero rows; module/sensor timestamps rendered in row timezone.
- Usage upload acknowledges the persisted count. `upload_telemetry` cannot be disabled.

### Android
- OEM background guidance after enrollment (Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO, Huawei/Honor, Oppo/Realme/OnePlus, Vivo, Samsung); open/research builds request the battery exemption with the system dialog.
- Open flavor compiles the restricted collectors in (v58 collected nothing for sensor, accessibility, notification, sleep and activity modules).
- Queue write cursor monotonic across clock steps; direct-boot snapshot retired when the sensor gate closes; unknown encryption policy fails closed.
- Consent copy rendered as translatable resources with parity test; withdrawal text = uninstall the app.
- versionCode 59.

### Dashboard
- Settings writes send `If-Match`; conflict message on 412; untouched participant policy not re-sent; unknown modules carried through.
- Public research policy page retired. i18n report fails on empty keys; catalog guards. `dev:local` refuses non-loopback host.

### Models and API
- Retrofit responses that cannot be deserialized fail instead of returning null; bodied DELETE declarations fixed; `AclKey` ordering fixed.
- Notification usage event types 10 and 12 named.

### Tooling
- Migration-safety gate in local CI (immutable published migrations, additive-only SQL, version ordering).
- Translator workbook export/import (`make i18n-sheet-export/import`); i18n lint tool gate.
- Toolchain pins: Gradle 9.7.1, Kotlin 2.4.10, Percona 18.6.1-1, Keycloak 26.7.3, Traefik 3.7.12, fluent-bit 5.1.1, Grafana 13.1.3; verify-toolchain checks active JDK, Python floor, every image pin. deps-freshness and fluent-bit-config CI jobs.
- Infra scripts fail loud (restore drill, backup archive, key rotation); dev host ports bound to loopback; plaintext replication pg_hba entry dropped; TDE key probe works on a fresh cluster.
- rhizome: honor `http2-enabled=false`, optional key-manager password, client-auth order. rhizome-client: retry backoff only before another attempt.

## [2026.9.4]

### Added

- Android Internal Testing build 58 (`2026.09.03-internal.open.1`): the open flavor with translation support, built and uploaded from local CI.
- `make changelog RELEASE=<version>` drafts the changelog entry from the commits staged for publish.

### Changed

- Public history is curated: `make publish-stage` lays the filtered private tree over the public tip and `make publish-push` fast-forwards the logical commits built from it, gated by a secrets scan and a commit-message check. Commit messages follow Conventional Commits; `docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md` describes the model.

### Fixed

- The self-host Grafana viewer helper crashed on Python 3.9 because of a postponed-annotation syntax in a signature.
- The capability-ownership check looked for English UI text that now lives in the translation table.

### Security

- Web dependencies: fast-uri 4.1.4, browserslist 4.28.8, and qs 6.16.0 close the advisories reported by `bun audit`.

## [2026.9.3]

### Added

- Translation support across the web dashboard, Android app, iOS app, and server-sent messages: English base tables with per-language override hooks, `Accept-Language` on every client call, and a dev-only `en-XA` pseudo-locale. Upstream Spanish, German, Swedish, and Hebrew diary wording is preserved verbatim.
- A hardcoded-string gate for every surface (`make i18n-lint`), with a table-driven proof suite and a mutation test (`make i18n-lint-proof`).
- Publishing from the private development repositories to the public mirrors, gated by a secrets scan and a `.publishignore` per repository.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md`.

### Changed

- All continuous integration now runs locally (`lefthook`, `scripts/local-ci.sh`). The GitHub Actions workflows and the checks that inspected them were retired; the Maestro emulator runner scripts moved to `tests/maestro/`.
- Android `SetTextI18n` is now a build error, and debug builds enable pseudolocales.


### Security

- The shared JVM dependency policy now requires RabbitMQ Java client 5.34.0 and verifies the new RabbitMQ/Netty artifacts used by the server and Rhizome builds.

### Fixed

- Public selfhost deployments now admit the Android app's bounded startup synchronization burst while retaining per-client edge and backend rate limits. [#159](https://github.com/uzaira0/methodic/pull/159)
