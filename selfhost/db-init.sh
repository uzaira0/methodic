# Everything that must be true before the backend first connects, run as a one-shot compose
# service so `docker compose up -d` is the whole deployment command.
#
# It runs on every `up`, not just the first: Flyway keeps adding tables, and the encryption
# sweep has to see them. Every step below is idempotent.
#
# Ordering matters and is the reason this runs BEFORE the backend rather than after it, the
# way the old host-side `./chronicle up` did. init-tde.sh sets the database's default access
# method to tde_heap, so once it has run, every table Flyway creates is encrypted at
# creation. Sweeping afterwards also works but rewrites each table it missed, which on a
# first boot meant converting the whole schema instead of creating it encrypted.

# Each dump is the whole database in one file, written by the backup image as 0644 -- that
# image never calls umask, so the file mode cannot be changed from compose. Access is denied
# one level up instead: at 0700 no other local account can traverse in.
#
# Ownership runs the whole way down, not just the top directory. The backup image used to run
# as root, which left every dump and every rotation subdirectory root:root inside an
# operator-owned 0700 parent. The operator could read a dump but could not delete one, move
# one, or prune the tree -- `rm` answered "Permission denied" on their own backups, and the
# only way to reclaim the disk was sudo. db-backup now runs as the operator (see
# overlays/backups.yml), and this reclaims anything a previous root-owned run left behind, so
# an existing deployment is repaired by the next `./chronicle up` rather than needing a manual
# chown.
#
# The owner must be the OPERATOR, not root, for a second reason: Docker creates a missing
# bind-mount source as root, and root-owned 0700 locks the operator out too, which breaks the
# backend image build -- its context is the repository root, and the context sender runs as the
# operator and dies with "permission denied" rather than skipping the directory. Nothing here
# knows the operator's uid, so take it from the bundle directory itself, which they own.

# SQL. Storing it next to the dumps adds no exposure those dumps do not already carry; what
# stays apart is the key and the *encrypted volume*, and it does.
