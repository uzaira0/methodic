# Contributing

Chronicle is developed in private repositories and published to these public mirrors.
Each publish condenses the private work into logical commits with Conventional Commits
messages. Experiments, reverts, and operational detail stay private.

## How to contribute

- **Issues** are open on the root repository ([uzaira0/methodic](https://github.com/uzaira0/methodic)).
  Include the commit you are on (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) and what you observed.
- **Pull requests** are welcome against the default branch of any public repository. A
  maintainer integrates an accepted change into the private tree, and the next publish
  carries it here with your authorship preserved (the original commit, or a fresh one with
  `Co-authored-by`, and a changelog line linking the pull request). The pull request itself
  is closed at that point rather than merged, because public history is written only by the
  publish step.
- **Security problems**: do not open an issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Before opening a pull request

1. Run the local checks. There is no hosted CI; everything runs on your machine:

   ```bash
   lefthook install                # secrets scan on commit, lint gates on push
   scripts/local-ci.sh fast        # the same gates a publish runs
   scripts/i18n-lint.sh            # no hardcoded user-facing English
   ```

2. Keep the change focused: one behaviour per pull request, tests alongside the code,
   and no unrelated reformatting.
3. Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (`fix(web): keep the switcher off the diary`),
   with a body that says why; `scripts/check-commit-msg.sh <file>` checks a draft and
   `docs/GIT-WORKFLOW.md` has the types, scopes, and examples.
4. User-facing strings go through the translation tables (web `src/modern/i18n`, Android
   `values/strings.xml`, iOS String Catalogs, server `messages.properties`). Never author
   translations; add the English key and leave the other languages to translators.

## Working with the submodules

The root repository pins every submodule to a public commit. Clone recursively:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/uzaira0/methodic.git chronicle
```

Changes that span repositories should be one pull request per repository, cross-linked.
