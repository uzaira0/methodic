Usage: scripts/chronicle-dogfood-report.sh [options]

Prints a local Postgres data-quality dogfood report for one Chronicle
participant. Covers: device/app-version inventory, upload buffer queue depth,
usage event counts, ActivityClass coverage and top missing-activityClass
packages, device lifecycle events (shutdown/startup, screen/keyguard,
battery/power/network), hardware sensor sample counts and types, the modeled
sensor availability matrix, last upload timestamps per stream, malformed row
counts, duplicate/replay counts, clock skew, future-timestamp rows, and stale
participants.

All secrets and participant-sensitive values are redacted: this script never
prints API keys, the mobile signing secret, or the Postgres password.

Options:
  --study-id UUID         study UUID
  --participant-id ID     participant ID
  -h, --help              show help

Environment overrides: CHRONICLE_STUDY_ID, CHRONICLE_PARTICIPANT_ID,
CHRONICLE_POSTGRES_CONTAINER, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_PASSWORD.
Postgres credentials are read from docker/.env when not set in the environment.
