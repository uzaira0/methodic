# The backend WRITES these when provisioning/rotating a study key and READS them for
# decrypt-on-read/export — so this path needs create/update/read (the chronicle/* secrets
# above are read-only by contrast). Keys are never deleted in place (rotation mints a new
# keyId); destructive ops stay denied below so prior ciphertext stays decryptable.
